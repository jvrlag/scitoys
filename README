****** SCITOYS

Small scientific animations in C++, using the hvb libraries

Developers:
Javier Rodriguez-Laguna, Instituto de Física Teórica, CSIC (Spain)


1. PURPOSE

Gather beautiful scientific animations which also have didactic value.


2. INSTALLATION

In order to watch all the animations, you need the following
libraries, including the development files:

* BLAS & LAPACK
* X11
* Imlib2

For example, in ubuntu, apply the following command:

>> sudo apt-get install g++ libblas3 libblas-dev liblapack3 liblapack-dev libx11-dev libimlib2 libimlib2-dev

In other UNIX systems the packages may have different names.

Now enter each directory and do:

>> make xtest
>> ./xtest


3. OUR SCITOYS

- xthreebody.cc, solves numerically the three-body problem.

- xgoldenspiral.cc, animation of discrete spirals close to the golden one.

- xpascal.cc, shows the Pascal triangle mod m, for m in {1..20}

- xpassive.cc, animation of a passive scalar field advected by a
  turbulent flow composed of many vortices.

- xsqpiral.cc, discrete spiral, simple algorithm but wonderful patterns.
